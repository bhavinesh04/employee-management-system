Employee Management System (EMS)

Employee Management System (EMS) is a full-stack web application built using the MERN stack to manage employees, tasks, and internal communication within an organization. The system provides role-based access with separate dashboards for admins and employees.

Admins can create employees, assign and review tasks, reset passwords, and send messages. Employees can view assigned tasks, submit completed work with file uploads, and track task status. The application uses JWT-based authentication and follows a modern client–server architecture. The UI is fully responsive and optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
